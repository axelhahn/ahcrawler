## Page: Vendor Libs

To save space the application does not contain vendor libs for the frontend. They will be included via CDN. But if you want you can download one or all.

In the table you see used vendor libraries and the place where they are loaded from. Using remote or local libs has no functional impact.
Download the libaries to increase the speed of this web app and/ or to run it without additional internet access.
Libaries marked with "(not used anymore)" were replaced and can be deleted locally.
