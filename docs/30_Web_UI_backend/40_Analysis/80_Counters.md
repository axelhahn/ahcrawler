## page: Counters

Each crawler run for a project saves a set of counter variables. 

If you run the crawler multiple times per day then the values of the latest run overwrite the values of the current day.

On this page you can browse through all generated counters.

On the left side you can select a counter by clicking on the button with a counter name.

On the right side you can see the graph of the last days and a table with date and the corresponding counter value.
