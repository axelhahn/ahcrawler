## Create a profile

Go to the [Profiles] and set up a web page.
As minimum you need:

* A label (Short title)
* List of start urls for the crawler - i.e. `https://www.example.com/`
* optional: you have a larger website (>50 web pages) you can limit the count url to crawl in the first few test runs.
* press [create]

For all settings see [Profile](/30_Web_UI_backend/30_Start/50_Profiles.md)
