### 2022

#### 2022-12-12: v0.156

**Important note:**

This is a large update!

The folder structure was changed: The files of the software and web ui were moved to "public_html" subfolder. This update will break installations that were initialized with a `git pull`.

If you installed the software with git then you need to change the webserver config.

The reason is: I added my local dev environment (rootless docker) and rewrote the current help with markdown files and added it too.

Finally there were changes in the code to improve the search and to unify backend layout elements.

* ↗️ UPDATE: public search 
  * highlight searchterms in title, url, description, keywords, preview ...
  * added variable for hits per term or which term was not found
  * added meta information including timers and request data
  * added {{TOTALTIME}} (time in ms for search) and {{HITCOUNT}} (number of search results) in head template
  * added {{COUNTER}} in search result template for number of search result item
  *  output template: added html placeholders to show data with and without marked searchterm hits
    eg. {{TITLE}} and {{HTML_TITLE}}
  * placeholders from head can be used in search result template too
