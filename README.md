It is written in PHP and consists of
- crawler (spider) and indexer
- search for your website
- website analyzer with
  - ssl certificate check
  - saved cookies
  - http response header check
  - linkchecker (http status check of all links, css, images, ...)

It runs on PHP - up to version 8.3 (maybe it runs on PHP 8.0 - but this is an already outdated version).
It uses PDO to store indexed data. So far sqlite and mysql were tested.

This is not a version 1.x yet ... let me do some more work :-)
